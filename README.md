This app has been produced to allow me to view and control parameters from my Arduino/PI based underfloor heating control system.

The app works with emoncms.org which is an open source data repository for use with applications in home energy monitoring.

The application reads and writes data to this repository to allow for 'feeds' to be displayed and a specific feed written to.

The feed that is written to is the control target for the underfloor heating temperature. This feed is read by my home monitoring
system and if it is a sensible control target, used to control the underfloor heating.
